# HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS
- The <(!DOCTYPE html)> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files. This lets the browser know what version of HTML to expect.
- The <(html)> element will contain all of your HTML code.
- Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <(head)> of the page.
- You can add a title to your web page by using the <(title)> element, inside of the head.
- A webpage’s title appears in a browser’s tab.
- Anchor tags <(a)> are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.
- You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using <(a)> tags and adding ids to the elements you wish to jump to.
- Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.
- Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.
- Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <(!-- comment --)>.

NB:- Ignore the () while writing code
