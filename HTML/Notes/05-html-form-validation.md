# HTML FORM VALIDATION
- Client-side validations happen in the browser before information is sent to a server.
- Adding the required attribute to an input related element will validate that the input field has information in it.
- Assigning a value to the min attribute of a number input element will validate an acceptable minimum value.
- Assigning a value to the max attribute of a number input element will validate an acceptable maximum value.
- Assigning a value to the minlength attribute of a text input element will validate an acceptable minimum number of characters.
- Assigning a value to the maxlength attribute of a text input element will validate an acceptable maximum number of characters.
- Assigning a regex to pattern matches the input to the provided regex.
- If validations on a <(form)> do not pass, the user gets a message explaining why and the <(form)> cannot be submitted.
